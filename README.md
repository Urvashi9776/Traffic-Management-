# Traffic Management System

## üö¶ Overview

The **Traffic Management System** is designed to provide real-time monitoring of road traffic. Using **YOLOv8** for object detection, it can detect, track, and count vehicles, while also estimating their speed. This solution helps in managing traffic flow, enhancing road safety, and potentially reducing congestion.

## üéØ Features

- **Object Detection**: Detects vehicles using **YOLOv8** with high accuracy.
- **Vehicle Tracking**: Tracks multiple vehicles in real-time across video frames.
- **Vehicle Counting**: Counts the number of vehicles passing through specific zones.
- **Speed Estimation**: Calculates the speed of vehicles based on tracking data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **YOLOv8**: Object detection
- **OpenCV**: Image processing and video feed handling
- **Python**: Core development language

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-management-system.git
cd traffic-management-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download YOLOv8 Weights

Download the pre-trained YOLOv8 weights from the [Ultralytics repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov8) and place them in the `models/` folder.

### 4. Run the System

To analyze traffic from a video feed or live camera:

```bash
python main.py --source <video_file_or_camera_feed>
```

## üöÄ Future Scope & Contributions

We're actively seeking contributions to enhance the functionality and expand the scope of this project. Some potential areas for improvement include:

- **Integration of Pedestrian and Cyclist Detection**: Improve road safety by adding detection for non-vehicle entities.
- **Traffic Light Detection**: Analyze traffic behavior in relation to signal changes.
- **Advanced Speed Estimation**: Refine the accuracy of speed estimation under different conditions.
- **Data Analytics Dashboard**: Develop a real-time dashboard for traffic data visualization.
