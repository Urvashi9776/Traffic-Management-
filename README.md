# 🚦 Traffic Management System 🚦

Welcome to the **Traffic Management System**, where computer vision meets traffic control! This project utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to detect and track vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists for better traffic monitoring and management. Powered by **YOLOv8**, this system ensures real-time traffic analysis and safety on the road.


## 🌟 Features

- 🔍 **Real-time Object Detection**: Detect vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with precise bounding boxes.
- 🚗 **Vehicle Tracking**: Follow the movement of detected objects across video frames.
- 📊 **Vehicle Counting**: Count the number of vehicles passing through a predefined area.
- ⏱️ **Speed Estimation**: Calculate vehicle speeds using frame rate and object movement.
- 🚶‍♂️🚴‍♀️ **Pedestrian and Cyclist Detection**: Include vulnerable road users in traffic analysis for increased safety.

## 🚀 Getting Started

With cities growing and road traffic increasing, it’s essential to have effective traffic management systems in place. This project tackles real-time traffic monitoring by detecting and tracking vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. If you're looking to develop or contribute to a **cutting-edge traffic management solution**, you're in the right place!

## 🔧 Installation

Get the project up and running in just a few steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Urvashi9776/Traffic-Management.git
    cd Traffic-Management
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download YOLOv8 Pre-trained Weights**:
   - Download weights from the official YOLOv8 repository.
   - Place the weights in the `models/` directory.

4. **Run the System**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### 🛠️ Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can begin analyzing traffic videos or live camera feeds.

1. **Basic Command**:
    ```bash
    python main.py --input /path/to/video.mp4
    ```

2. **Adjust Confidence Level**:
    ```bash
    python main.py --input /path/to/video.mp4 --confidence 0.5
    ```

3. **For Live Feed**:
    Connect a camera and use the following command to start detection in real-time:
    ```bash
    python main.py --input 0
    ```

### 🎯 Results

View a real-time stream with:

- **Bounding Boxes** 🟦 around vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians.
- **Object Count**: A real-time counter displaying the number of detected objects.
- **Speed Estimation**: Estimated speed (in km/h) displayed for each moving vehicle.
